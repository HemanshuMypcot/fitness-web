                <p>As a general rule, no refund will be provided until and unless such circumstances exist that the Website deems fit to refund the transaction money. A Buyer may submit a claim for a refund for a purchase made by emailing at support@snapay.in and providing a clear and specific reason for the refund request and the exact terms that have been violated. Whether a refund will be provided will be determined by the Website, in its sole discretion. Refund requests must be submitted within 10 days of the purchase or within any such duration, as indicated by the Sellers. In case a Buyer has a dispute with the Seller where he/she wants a refund for the amount paid to the Seller, Buyer should create a case using the link on the transaction mail within 10 days from the date of transaction/purchase or placing the Order. In case of failure to do so by the Buyer, he/she agrees that it absolves the Website from any responsibility to facilitate the resolution of such dispute. The Buyer agrees not to dispute/chargeback the transaction with his/her credit card issuing bank without informing or obtaining prior consent of the Website. 1% of amount will be deducted from your payment for cancellation.</p>
